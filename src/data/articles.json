The town quickly grew to about fifty well-maintained structures built of logs and flagstones with three deep wells providing water. The town is dominated by an apple orchard on the west side and a ruined manor atop a hill to the east. The townsfolk congregate in a small town square and an adjacent town green. When Phandalin was reestablished in the late 15th century DR, at first it had no real functioning government, and the Phandalin Miner's Exchange began acting as a center of records-keeping for local mining claims. The townsfolk also annually elected a 'Townmaster' who served as a judge and mediator as well as kept town records. In 1491 DR, Harbin Wester was the perennial Townmaster."

The formal agreement of the pact was essentially that the three parties would share the profits of the Wave Echo Cave. The cave had great mineral wealth, and was highly magical. The human mages, along with the original clans of the pact, bound the magical energy into a forge known as the Forge of Spells. The magical forge could be used to enchant items, such as dwarven weapons and gnomish gadgets."

The benefits of the pact were outlined in the document, The Wonders of Phandalin. In 951 DR, orcs from Uruth Ukrypt laid waste to the entire town of Phandalin leaving only a few burnt out shells behind. All parties of the pact fought together, but were severely outmanned, and were eventually overthrown. The successful pact ceased to exist once the orcish brutes destroyed most of the area. The cavern became lost to history. In 1491 DR, Gundren Rockseeker believed he had found the location of the legendary mines of the Phandelver's Pact."
