Later, a group of human spellcasters and those of the town of Phandalin became allied with them. The formal agreement of the pact was essentially that the three parties would share the profits of the Wave Echo Cave. The cave had great mineral wealth, and was highly magical. The human mages, along with the original clans of the pact, bound the magical energy into a forge known as the Forge of Spells. The magical forge could be used to enchant items, such as dwarven weapons and gnomish gadgets.</p> </div><div class="m-4"> <h2 class="h2">History:</h2> <p>After the pact was established, all parties benefited greatly. Phandalin, especially, became very prosperous. The benefits of the pact were outlined in the document, The Wonders of Phandalin. In 951 DR, orcs from Uruth Ukrypt laid waste to the entire town of Phandalin leaving only a few burnt out shells behind. All parties of the pact fought together, but were severely outmanned, and were eventually overthrown. The successful pact ceased to exist once the orcish brutes destroyed most of the area. The cavern became lost to history. In 1491 DR, Gundren Rockseeker believed he had found the location of the legendary mines of the Phandelver&#39;s Pact.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="w-[33%] p-4 flex flex-col items-center gap-4 sidebar-content"> <div class="w-[100%]" slot="sidebar-content">  <h3 class="h3 text-center">Phandelver Pact</h3>     <h4 class="h4">Organization Details:</h4> <div> <p><b>Type: </b>Commercial Pact</p> </div> <div> <p><b>Reach: </b>Regional</p> </div> <div> <p><b>Location: </b>Wave Echo Cave</p> </div><div> <p><b>Status: </b>Disbanded</p> </div>  </div> </div> </div>  </div> </div> </body></html>
