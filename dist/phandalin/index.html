It was raided by orcs in 961 DR and subsequently abandoned.</p> </div><div class="m-4"> <h2 class="h2">Re-settlement:</h2> <p>Phandalin is a modest and architecturally boring town of hard-working frontiersfolk built atop the ruins of the old Phandalin. The town quickly grew to about fifty well-maintained structures built of logs and flagstones with three deep wells providing water. The town is dominated by an apple orchard on the west side and a ruined manor atop a hill to the east. The townsfolk congregate in a small town square and an adjacent town green. When Phandalin was reestablished in the late 15th century DR, at first it had no real functioning government, and the Phandalin Miner&#39;s Exchange began acting as a center of records-keeping for local mining claims. The townsfolk also annually elected a &#39;Townmaster&#39; who served as a judge and mediator as well as kept town records. In 1491 DR, Harbin Wester was the perennial Townmaster.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="w-[33%] p-4 flex flex-col items-center gap-4 sidebar-content"> <div class="w-[100%]" slot="sidebar-content"> <img src="/phandelverScene.webp" alt="Phandalin"> <h3 class="h3 text-center">Phandalin</h3>    <h4 class="h4">Landmark Details:</h4> <div> <p><b>Type: </b>Settlement</p> </div> <div> <p><b>Location: </b>Sword Coast, between the Sword Montains and Neverwinter Woods</p> </div>   </div> </div> </div>  </div> </div> </body></html>
